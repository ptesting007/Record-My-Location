<h1>Can I take notes?</h1>

While you are recording positions you can press the big area in the
<b>Capture tab</b> to annotate something: a special location, an instance in
time you want to remember for some reason, etc. A note taking screen will show
up with the option to take a picture.
<p>
Since this software only exports text logs, your picture will be saved to the
device's photo library, separate from the GPS locations. Still, a note will be
present in the logs reminding you when/where you took it, and you can use the
picture's date to match it with the note later at your computer.
