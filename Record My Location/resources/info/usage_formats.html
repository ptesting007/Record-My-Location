<h1>File formats</h1>

The program can generate CSV and GPX files. The CSV files are comma separated
value text files where each column represents a value recorded by the device.
The file will contain a header with the name of the stored value. If you don't
want to parse this file yourself, you can use the python script avaialble at <a
	href="https://github.com/gradha/Record-my-position/tree/master/csv_to_kml">https://github.com/gradha/Record-my-position/tree/master/csv_to_kml</a>
to convert it into a KML file which you can open with Google Earth.
<p>
The GPX file format is supported by many programs, so it is likely you will be
able to use it straight away with any geographical program. However, not all
the information stored in the CSV file is recorded on the GPX version. For
instance, one of the columns in the CSV file stores the amount of battery power
left on your device at that time (so you can make statistics about power usage)
and another the reachability of internet websites (useful for mapping free wifi
zones). These are values not stored in the GPX version.
