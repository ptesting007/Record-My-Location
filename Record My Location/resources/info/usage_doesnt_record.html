<h1>It doesn't record my positions</h1>

This software works on all devices but some devices lack multitasking support.
Whether your device supports recording GPS positions in the background or not
is shown in the <b>Capture tab</b> of the application. You should see something
like "<em>Multitasking available</em>".
<p>
If multitasking is <b>not</b> available, the program will stop recording
positions as soon as you press the home button on your device. Capturing
positions will resume when you run again the program.
<p>
Also, version 1.4.2 of the software added a new switch to the <b>Capture
	tab</b> named <b>Save all GPS positions</b>. This switch is by default
enabled, but if you turn it off the program won't save the positions retrieved
by the GPS antenna unless you press the button on the screen. The button will
save a single position (the last one) to the database in this mode. Before
pressing the button make sure the accuracy of the GPS reading is good enough
for your needs.
