<h1>How do I export logs?</h1>

Once you have captured at least one position, you can export the location data
in two ways: send the logs to you by email or generate files on the device. If
you select exportation by mail, the files will be attached to an email template
where you have to enter the address.
<p>
Not everybody has an email, so another option is to generate files on the
device. Once you generate those files, you have to connect your device to a
machine with iTunes to retrieve them. Inside iTunes, click on the device you
have connected, go to the applications tab and select the Record my GPS program
in the lower part of the tab. There you should see a file exchange area where
the generated files are. Drag them to your desktop to use them with other
software.
<p>
Note that while the program can export the log files to the device, you won't
be able to access them from iTunes unless your device has iOS 4.0 or greater.
iOS 3.x doesn't allow accessing files through iTunes.
