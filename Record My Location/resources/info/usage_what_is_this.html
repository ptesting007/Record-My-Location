<h1>What is this for?</h1>

<b>Record my GPS position</b> is a simple program which allows you to record
the location information provided by your device. Most programs limit the
information you can get out of it, but this program shows everything you can
get from the hardware. The information is always provided in raw CSV (comma
separated values) files and optionally GPX files, which are supported by many
geolocation programs, though they store less raw information.
<p>
With <b>Record my GPS position</b> you can find out the distance between two
points, remember the turns you took driving into a new city, or share with
other people new tracks you made riding your bike.
<p>
To start recording your positon turn on the switch at the top of the
<b>Capture tab</b>. You should immediately see how the rest of the screen
changes to display your current position. While the switch is on, the device
will record your position for as long as this program is working (devices
without iOS multitasking support stop recording when you exit the program!).
<p>
By default the program records all received positions from the GPS, but you can
turn off the <b>Save all GPS positions</b> switch, and now positions will be
saved only when you press the button above that switch. Note that even if you
don't save any position the battery will still run out faster due to the GPS
being active!
